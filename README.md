RML Data Retrieval
==================

RML Data Retrieval implementation supports the [RML Processor](https://github.com/mmlab/RMLProcessor/) to access and retrieve the data sources.

The existing implementation supports different dataset and service descriptions for data access in RDF.

The access interfaces supported at the moment are 
* Dump files 
* [DCAT](http://www.w3.org/TR/vocab-dcat/) for Data Catalogues
* [Hydra](http://www.w3.org/ns/hydra/spec/latest/core/) for Web APIs
* subset of [D2RQ](http://d2rq.org/d2rq-language) for Database Access Interface
* [SPARQL-SD](http://www.w3.org/TR/sparql11-service-description/) for SPARQL Service

Detailed examples of possible descriptions and their alignment with RML can be found at [RML Data Sources] (http://rml.io/RMLdataRetrieval.html)
